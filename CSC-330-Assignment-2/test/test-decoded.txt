The thing is, if the text is all on one line, we have a full understanding and mutual agreement that this Huffman compression works to some extent. Conversely, if there are wrapped lines that would normally end with the escape character, then we are somewhat up the creek without a paddle. As we see, when one is typing all of the text on the same line, and allows the program to wrap the lines automatically, we can get optimal results with our Huffman compression. As such, we see a fifty percent reduction in size in the optimal cases, though, the majority of the time results in bigger files (upwards of 60 to 70 percent if strange and non-normal characters appear).r
